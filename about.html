          <h3>Multimedia Artist</h3>
          <p>
            Sheena is a multidisciplinary artist who uses installation,
            photography, and performance to interrogate how the body
            occupies space/time. As a disabled nonbinary multiracial
            immigrant, disability, queerness, race, and immigration are
            all central to their work. They are especially interested in
            these themes as they relate to the borders of identity and
            personhood on the micro scale (i.e. family) and the macro one
            (i.e. nation). Additional themes include chaos and
            hyperstimulation, which frequently show up in their work
            through layering and glitch. Sheena explores such themes and
            methodologies in order to capture that transformative place
            where the personal becomes the public, and thereby hold up the
            density of the human experience as not only normal but also
            necessary as a marker of growth. This show in particular is a
            direct reflection of the complicated and ever-evolving
            relationship of the self and the other. Through collaboration
            and varying degrees of tech, Sheena searches for meaning in
            the way bodies take up space in harmony/conflict with one
            another—digging into how Asian Rage might inform and
            complicate this dichotomy. The show draws on Sheena’s unique
            lineage of contemporary choreographic idols such as Ralph
            Lemon, mentors such as Xan Burley, and collaborators. It also
            draws on theory/art (historical) inspirations revolving around
            Afro-optimism, glitch feminism, and the contemporary practice
            of performance art, particularly the 60’s/70’s generation of
            artists that included Yoko Ono and Marina Abramovic.
            Ultimately, it works to continue this lineage in such a way
            that further challenges and thereby expands what it means to
            hold politically targeted identities in this day and age while
            never compromising the tenacity and community needed to
            survive it.
